## Testing

- I tested to see if the website would work on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and using Chrome Dev Tools, simulated different device screen widths and lenghts.

- The website was able to function as intended and that the it was responsive.

- The navigation bar, header, titles and text were all readable and easy to understand.

- The review form works: requires entries in the required field, only accept an email in the email field and submit and rest button works.

### Validator Testing

- HTML



- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

- Accesibility
