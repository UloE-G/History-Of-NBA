      <p>Before we begin to discuss the creation and rise of the NBA, we must first mention the creation of
        basketball.
        Basketball was invented by <span>James Naismith</span> in winter 1891 at Springfield College. James was a
        31-year-old
        graduate
        student who was studying physical-education which was a new academic discipline at the time under Luther
        Halsey
        Gulick who is consider by many as the father of physical education and recreation in the United States.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 1891, Gulick introduced a new course called the psychology of play where he believed that a
        new
        indoor game needed to be created “that would be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play in the winter and
        by
        artificial light.” Gulick assigned this task to Naismith.</p>
      <h3>Creation</h3>
      <p>Naismith took the challenge and began to create a game that was easy to assimilate, yet complex enough to be
        interesting. It had to be playable indoors or on any kind of ground, and by a large number of players all at
        once.
        It should provide plenty of exercise, yet without the roughness of football, soccer, or rugby since those
        would
        threaten bruises and broken bones if played in a confined space.</p>
      <p>The game took inspiration from sports like American rugby for its passing, English rugby because of the jump
        ball, lacrosse because of the use of a goal, the shape and size of the ball was inspired by football and a
        game
        called duck on a rock, this was a game Naismith played with his childhood friends in Bennie's corners,
        Ontario.Duck on a rock used a ball and a goal that could not be rushed. The goal could not be slammed through,
        thus necessitating “a goal with a horizontal opening high enough so that the ball would have to be tossed into
        it,
        rather than being thrown.”</p>
      <div class="pictures2">
        <img src="assets/images/Early_outdoor_basketball_game.jpg" alt="Look at early version of basketaball">
      </div>
      <p>Naismith approached the school janitor, hoping he could find two, 18-inch square boxes to use as goals. The
        janitor came back with two peach baskets instead. Naismith then nailed them to the lower rail of the gymnasium
        balcony, one at each end. The height of that lower balcony rail happened to be ten feet. A man was stationed
        at
        each end of the balcony to pick the ball from the basket and put it back into play.</p>
      <p>Naismith then drew up the 13 original rules, which described, among other facets, the method of moving the
        ball
        and what constituted a foul. A referee was appointed. The game would be divided into two, 15-minute halves
        with
        a
        five-minute resting period in between. Naismith’s secretary typed up the rules and tacked them on the bulletin
        board. A short time later, the gym class met, and the teams were chosen with three centers, three forwards,
        and
        three guards per side. Two of the centers met at mid-court, Naismith tossed the ball, and the game of “basket
        ball” was born.</p>

      <h2>The start of the NBA</h2>
    </div>
    <p>The NBA (short for the <span>National Basketball Association</span>) is a professional basketball leauge in North
      America made up of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is one of the major professional sports
      leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the best professional basketball league in the world.
    </p>
  </div>
    <p>The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the <span>Baskeball Association of
      America</span>
    (BAA) which the NBA claims its history as its own. It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on
    August 3, 1949, after merging with the <span>National Basketball League </span> (NBL).
    </p>
    <h3>Early Days</h3>
    <p>With this merger the NBA has seventeen franchises located in a mix of small and large cities throughout the
      United States and Canada like the Toronto Huskies, New York Knicks and Boston Celtics.</p>

    <p>Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the
    New York
    Knicks. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold
    Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.</p>
    <h3>Competiton</h3>
    <p>In 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the <span>American Basketball
        Association</span> (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war for one of the most important college star of the
      era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to
      the ABA, as did four veteran referees—Norm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.</p>
    <p>In 1969, Alan
    Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the
    modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of Jerry West, based on a photo by Wen
    Roberts. The NBA would not confirm that a particular player was used because, according to Siegel, <em>"They want
      to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal
      point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one
      player."</em> The logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.</p>

      <h2>Rise</h2>
      <p>In the beginning of 1979 the leauge added the three-point field goal which was from the ABA. This was done the
        same year rookies Magic Johnson and Larry Bird joined, Johnson signing to the Los Angelels Lakers and Bird
        siging to the Boston Celtics. These two are credited by many as the players who saved the NBA from fincial
        collapse as the years prior the leauge saw saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player
        issues.</p>
      <p>Michael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls. The arrival of Micheal Jordan helped grow the
        league exponetionally as he became the new face of the league and is argued to be one the greatest basketball
        players to ever play.</p>
