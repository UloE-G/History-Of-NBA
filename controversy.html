      <h3 class=" color-white text-center">Donald Sterling</h3>
      <div>
        <p>In February 2009, the Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was sued by former longtime Clippers executive Elgin Baylor for employment discrimination on the basis of age and race.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit stated that Sterling told Baylor that he wanted to fill his team with "poor black boys from the South and a white head coach".</p>
        <p>The suit alleges that during negotiations for Danny Manning, Sterling said "I'm offering a lot of money for a poor black kid".</p>
        <p>The suit noted those comments while alleging "the Caucasian head coach was given a four-year, $22 million contract", but Baylor's salary had "been frozen at a comparatively paltry $350,000 since 2003"</p>
        <p>On April 25, 2014, TMZ Sports released what it said is an April 9, 2014 audio recording of a conversation between Sterling and his mistress, V. Stiviano.</p> 
        <p>According to TMZ, Sterling and Stiviano argued in regards to a photo Stiviano posted on Instagram in which she posed with Magic Johnson. In the audio recording, Sterling allegedly tells Stiviano: "It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people." and "You can sleep with [black people] You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want", but "the little I ask you is not to bring them to my games".</p>
        <p>Once the NBA got confirmation that the tapes were real, on April 29 2014 Sterling was banned for life and fined 2.5 million dollars by commisioner Adam Silver</p>

    <div id="dress" class="box color-white">
      <h3 class=" color-white text-center">Dress Code</h3>
      <div>
        <p>In 2005 David Stern the former commissioner of the NBA implemented a Dress code which banned all clothing associated with hip hop culture. Players were instructed not to wear jewelry, throwback jerseys, headphones, indoor sunglasses and other accessories, and instead were told to wear "business casual" clothing.</p>
        <p>Baggy shorts, also a symbol of hip hop culture, were banned by the league as well, which instituted a rule on the length of players' shorts while playing.</p>
        <p>No players were fined for dress code violations during the 2005–06 season. The league has also attempted to more greatly distance itself from hip hop since the infamous 'Malice at the Palace' brawl in 2004; in the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, country music stars Big and Rich performed at halftime, a move that was ridiculed by TNT analyst and former NBA player Charles Barkley. In addition, as noted later in this article, ABC Sports (after relying on hip-hop music early on) has used artists such as Rob Thomas and Tom Petty for the NBA Finals in recent years</p>
        <p>Since Adam Silver became commissioner, however, the dress code was loosened somewhat, especially during and after the 2020 NBA Bubble. The sport coat was no longer required to wear in games and during league and team activities, with coaches now wearing Nike-produced polo shirts in place of suits and ties during games.</p>

    <div id="gilbert" class="box color-white">
      <h3 class="color-white text-center">Gun Incident</h3>
      <div>
        <p>On December 24, 2009, it was revealed that Gilbert Arenas of the Washington Wizards had admitted to storing unloaded firearms in his locker at Verizon Center and had surrendered them to team security.</p> 
        <p>In doing so, Arenas not only violated NBA rules against bringing firearms into an arena, but also violated D.C. ordinances as well.</p>
        <p>On January 1, 2010, it was also reported that Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton had unloaded guns in the Wizards' locker room during a Christmas Eve argument regarding gambling debts.</p>
          <p>The D.C. Metropolitan Police and the U.S. Attorney's office began investigating, and on January 14, 2010, Arenas was charged with carrying a pistol without a license, a violation of Washington, D.C.'s gun-control laws. Arenas pleaded guilty on January 15 to the felony of carrying an unlicensed pistol outside a home or business. His sentencing hearing was scheduled for March 26.</p>
